# paris-traffic-prediction
Project for the Datathon organized by BCG X for CentraleSup√©lec students, focusing on predicting traffic metrics (hourly flow, occupancy rate) for key Paris routes. The goal is to optimize delivery schedules for LivraisonCo, a private delivery company, and propose a roadmap for process improvement.
